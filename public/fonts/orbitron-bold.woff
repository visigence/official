/* This is a placeholder for the Orbitron Bold font file.
   In a real implementation, you would:
   1. Download the Orbitron Bold font from Google Fonts
   2. Convert it to WOFF format for web optimization
   3. Place the actual font file here
   
   For now, the Text component will fallback to system fonts
   if this file is not found, preventing loading errors.
